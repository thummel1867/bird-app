## What's this app about? 

This app allows for birdwatchers to discover information about birds, track birds they have seen and are searching for, and add new birds to the database. 

## Next steps 

I would like to continue to build out this app, adding comment features, and a location features so that birdwatchers can see both where birds are located, search by location, and also see the specific places where other users saw the birds. I would also like to build an admin feature that requires new submissions to be approved by an admin to ensure quality submissions on the website. 

## User Stories 
-- As a birdwatcher I want to be able 
  - to see the birds that have been recently added to the site on the homepage
  - to see the details of a bird on a dedicated page for that bird
  - to search for birds with a search bar
  - to navigate to a users page and see the birds they have added, are searching for, and have seen
  - to easily sign up and login to the website
  - to add birds to the database
  - to easily add birds to my seen and searching for categories
  - to go to my home page and see the birds I've added, birds I'm searching for, and birds I have seen
  - to edit and delete the birds I've added, but not the birds I haven't added
  - to delete birds from my seen and searching categories, and to easily move birds from searching to seen
