## What's this app about? 

This app allows for birdwatchers to discover information about birds, track birds they have seen and are searching for, and add new birds to the database. 

## Next steps 

I would like to continue to build out this app, adding comment features, and a location features so that birdwatchers can see both where birds are located, search by location, and also see the specific places where other users saw the birds. I would also like to build an admin feature that requires new submissions to be approved by an admin to ensure quality submissions on the website.
